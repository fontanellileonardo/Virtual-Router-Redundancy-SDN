# VRR - Virtual Router Redundancy

The aim of this project was to develop a Floodlight Controller for Software Defined Networking able to manage packets on a SDN switch. The two networks A & B are connected by two routers, one of which is master and the other serves as backup in case of failure.
The network is simulated by a mininet script. Both networks will only see one virtual router.
